-- @longdescr: Exposing hi-frequency events from a frameserver to the scripting
-- environment comes at a certain cost which although it may be negligible most
-- of the time, it is still unnecessary. This function can increase the level
-- of verbosity associated with a frameserver. An example for the use of this 
-- function is to get raw timing and framestatus updates from video playback 
-- (decode frameservers with a framequeue associated).
