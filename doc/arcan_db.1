.SH NAME
Arcan_db \- Database Support tool for Arcan 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B arcan_db dbfile 
.RI [COMMAND]
.B command-specific data 

.SH DESCRIPTION
The arcan_db tool manages the database that arcan uses as an application
specific key-value store, but also for controlling which programs (targets) and
which set of arguments (configuration) that are allowed to be launched
by an application using Arcan. 

.SH COMMAND
.IP "\fBadd_target\fR \fIname\fR \fIexecutable\fR \fIbfrm\fB \fIargv\fR"
Create a new target or update values for a pre-existing ones. The \fIname\fR
field is a unique identifier that will be used to reference the target from
within the engine. \fIexecutable\fR should point to the binary, folder or 
specific data file to be launched. \fIbfrm\fR specifies the binary format
to be loaded, where BIN corresponds to a native binary (e.g. ELF for POSIX
systems and PE on windows), LWA for using arcan-in-arcan style execution and 
RETRO for a libretro- compatible core (.so or .dll).

\fIArgv\fR can be a variable number of arguments that will be set as the base 
arguments for the target. For bfrm LWA, these will be passed to the application
and will be ignored for bfrm RETRO.

A configuration named \fIdefault\fR will also be created, this configuration
cannot be deleted without deleting the target.

.IP "\fBadd_target_kv\fR \fIname\fR \fIkey\fR \fIvalue\fR"

Define or update a key/value pair assoicated with the specific target.
These values are also accessible from the context of an arcan application.

.IP "\fBadd_target_env\fR \fItargetname\fR \fIkey\fR \fIvalue\fR"

Add a key/value pair (expands to key=value internally) that will be used
to set up the environment for the program. Those that are specific for
library interposition, e.g. LD_PRELOAD may be filtered and the _target_lib
command should be used for such purposes.

.IP "\fBadd_target_lib\fR \fItargetname\fR \fIlibstr\fR"

Add a library for interpositioning, 'hijack'. These are libraries used
to replace specific function calls in the subject. The specific mechanism
for accomplishing this is implementation defined, but the defaults are 
likely to use regular LD_PRELOAD or (on windows).

.IP "\fBadd_config\fR \fItargetname\fR \fIconfigname\fR \fIargv\fR"

Add configuration to the specific target. The arguments specified in
\fIargv\fR are similar to add_target but will always be appended after
the arguments associated with the target.

.IP "\fBadd_config_kv\fR \fItargetname\fR \fIconfigname\fR \fIargv\fR"

Add a key/value pair associated with a configuration, these values
are accessible from the context of an arcan application.

.IP "\fBdrop_config\fR \fItargetname\fR \fIconfigname\fR"

Delete the specific config. This will also remove any key/values associated
with that config. The configname 'default' cannot be removed in this way.

.IP "\fBdrop_target\fR \fItargetname\fR"

Delete the specific target and all associated configurations, environment
library and key/value pairs.

.SH SCRIPTING MODE
To assist when using this program as a database interface for a script,
a single dash can be specified instead of the command. Then the program
will process line- separated input from STDIN where each element is separated
with a tab character. The command format is otherwise the same as regular
usage. In addition, the program will output 'OK' or 'FAIL' to stderr in
response to each command (while stdout will contained the more detailed
error description). 

.SH NOTES
There is also a number of dump_ commands that are listed if you run the
program without any arguments. These are not intended as a serialization
or interfacing tool, interface with the arcan_db.c / arcan_db.h for those
kinds of purposes.

.SH BUGS
You can report bugs at the forum on the homepage or through the the AUTHOR
contact below. Save a snapshot of core-dumps (in the case of engine issues) or
the appropriate resources/logs entries. For some issues, a copy of the database
used and a list of files (with permissions) in themepath and
resourcepath might also be relevant.
