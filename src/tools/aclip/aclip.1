.SH NAME
aclip \- command line interface to Arcan clipboards
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B aclip [OPTIONS]

.SH DESCRIPTION
This tool is used to input- and/or monitor- an arcan connection point that
accepts clipboards.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-m, \-\-monitor\fR"
Continously monitor the clipboard for new entries and forward them to
standard output.

.IP "\fB\-e, \-\-exec\fR \fIcmd\fR"
Execute and pipe data to 'cmd' instead of stdout whenever a paste operation
is received on the clipboard in monitor mode (-m).

.IP "\fB\-s, \-\-separator\fR \fIsep\fR"
Override the separator that should be used between discrete monitor entries
from double-linefeed(default) to a user-defined string. This is used in -m
mode but ignored if -e used used at the same time.

.IP "\fB\-l, \-\-loop\fR \fIcount\fR"
Set a limit of discrete pastes that should be received from the clipboard
in monitor-mode before shutting down.

.IP "\fB\-d, \-\-display\fR \fIconnpath\fR"
By default, the ARCAN_CONNPATH environment is used in order to find an
arcan instance to connect to. This argument ignores that in favor for
the connpath argument.

.IP "\fB\-h, \-\-help\fR"
Show a brief summary of commands and usage.

.SH EXAMPLES

.PP
This examples places "hi there" on the clipboard.

.B echo "hi there" | aclip -p durden -i

.PP
Forward one clipboard entry to the selection buffer of an xserver using
the xclip tool.

.B aclip -m 1 | xclip

.SH LIMITATIONS
The appl that arcan is running must expose a connection point, and explicitly
allow clipboard and/or clipboard-paste primary segments to connect. This is
usually not added by default due to the security implications it might have.

Additional constraints may also have been placed on this connection point.
One common constraint is to only allow one active monitor or input connection.
Other constraints may be disabled input or disabled monitoring.

Consult the documentation for the appl you are using to get more information
on what applies to your particular scenario.

All inputs and outputs need to be valid UTF-8 or they will likely be silently
filtered. The tool is still young and few of the clipboard features offered by
Arcan are exposed yet, this means that right now, only adding text to a
clipboard, and monitoring the clipboard for entries actually work. Managing
binary blobs, audio and video streams will be added in the near future.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
