.SH NAME
Arcan \- Scripting Overview 

.SH SYNOPSIS
There is little work involved in getting a script up and running in Arcan.
Simply create a subdirectory in your themes directory (herein refered to as 
themename) named according to what you want the theme to be called 
[a-Z][a-Z,0-9] (the name needs to be a qualifying lua function name as well) 
along with a similarly named themename.lua file inside.
This lua file should, at the least, have one function defined with the 
same name as the theme. The following sections list the entry points that 
the engine will (optionally) look for when appropriate.

.SH Entry Points
.IP "\fBthemename()\fR" 
Invoked as soon as audio/video/event/database subsystems are active.

.IP "\fBthemename_clock_pulse(tickstamp, pulsecount)\fR"
Invoked every logical clock-pulse, or, depending on congestion at higher
loads, less often but with a pulsecount field set to the corresponding
number of ticks.

.IP "\fBthemename_input(evtbl)\fR"
Invoked every time a polled input device emitts an output, which varies
with user activity and filter configuration. Evtbl contains a number
of fields:
kind : touch
devid, subid, pressure, size, x, y

kind : analog
source, devid, subid, active, relative, samples

kind : digital, translated = true
number, keysym, modifiers, devid, subid, utf8, active, device, subdevice

kind : digital, translated = false
ource, devid, subid, active

.IP "\fBthemename_frame_pulse()\fR"
Invoked every video frame, this may occur at rather spurious intervals
depending on engine configuration. Any computation in this entrypoint
should be considered extremely costly.

.IP "\fBthemename_system(evtbl)\fR"
System events, evtbl.kind contains the corresponding event code.
Normal application use shouldn't have any use for this entrypoint.

.IP "\fBthemename_audio_event(source, evtbl)\fR"
Invoked whenever an audio event is successfully completed.
Look at the kind- field of evtbl for a more specific identifier,
some examples include "audio buffer underrun", "gain transformed", 
"playback finished", "playback aborted". The use of this function is 
discouraged, but the design issue on how the replacement
should work is still open.

.IP "\fBthemename_shutdown()\fR"
A shutdown() call will not immediately terminate but rather enqueue a
shutdown command on the eventqueue to allow future subsystems to terminate
in a clean manner. This entrypoint will be triggered as a final point
before the arcan process will exit.

.IP "\fBthemename_frameserver_event(source, evtbl)\fR"
The use of this entry-point is considered deprecated and replaced with
callback functions attached to each frameserver object.
