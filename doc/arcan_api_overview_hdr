.SH NAME
Arcan \- Scripting Overview

.SH SYNOPSIS
There is little work involved in getting an application (short, appl)
up and running in Arcan.
Simply create a directory with a qualifying name matching
([a-Z]1[a-Z,0-9]* along with a similarly named my_applname.lua file inside.
The following section list the entry points that
the engine will look for, when appropriate (replace xxx with the
qualifying name of your appl).

To speed things along, look at the wiki on arcan-fe.com and work
through the exercises corresponding to the ability level that you
want to achieve.

.SH Entry Points
.IP "\fBxxx()\fR"
Invoked as soon as audio/video/event/database subsystems are active.

.IP "\fBxxx_clock_pulse(tickstamp, pulsecount)\fR"
Invoked every logical clock-pulse, or, depending on congestion at higher
loads, less often but with a pulsecount field set to the corresponding
number of ticks. When the load is normal, pulsecount will equal 1.

.IP "\fBxxx_input(evtbl)\fR"
Invoked every time an input device emits a valid output sample,
this varies with user activity and filter configuration.
Evtbl contains a number of fields:
kind : touch
devid, subid, pressure, size, x, y

kind : analog
source, devid, subid, active, relative, samples

kind : digital, translated = true
number, keysym, modifiers, devid, subid, utf8, active, device, subdevice

kind : digital, translated = false
ource, devid, subid, active

.IP "\fBxxx_preframe_pulse() xxx_postframe_pulse()\fr"
Invoked right before and after synchronized transfer of a video frame, this may
occur at rather spurious intervals depending on engine configuration
and active synchronization strategy. Any computation in this entrypoint
should be considered costly and it is mainly provided for monitoring
purpsoes.

.IP "\fBxxx_adopt(vid, segid, title, parent, last)\fr"
Invoked when an application is set to collapse with transfers or when
recovering from a scripting error. It is used to allow the new script
to retrieve externally bound vids. Return true if the VID was adopted
otherwise it will be automatically deleted.

.IP "\fBxxx_display_state(action, id, state)\fr"
Invoked when there has been a change in the output display configuration
state, typically in response to hotplug events.

.IP "\fBxxx_shutdown()\fR"
This entrypoint will be triggered as a final state before the arcan
process will exit. The most reasonable use for this entrypoint is
terminating network connections with protocols that work better when
clients are cooperating, but also for saving configuration through
the database (e.g. store_key).
