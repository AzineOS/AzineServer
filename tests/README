This folder contains miniature, hacked together, scripts
used to assist in development or test some specific 
engine features and are not to be considered proper
"examples of use" (see the examples/ folder for that).

It is currently being refactored into the following 
substructure:

api_coverage/ (WIP) scripts that use the C pre-processor 
to extract examples and error cases from the documentation in 
doc/*.lua 

benchmark/ (WIP) specialized non-interactive cases that 
attempt to quantify performance boundaries for various platforms.

interactive/ quick hacks and experiments

regression/ for non-trivial bugs reported and fixed, an example
that provoced the issue pre-fix should be added to this folder
along with the fix, in order to have a growing base of regression
cases to run with any new release.
