This test is placed in the security category due to the DoS / resource
exhaustion possibilities and are simple loops for leak detection of shared
primitives.

The included frameserver is a connect -> draw -> draw -> die "unclean" loop
using the 'incontinence' connection key.

This is wrapped around a script that dumps the list of file descriptors,
mapped memory pages and /dev/shm entries for each iteration

The included appl will launch the default avfeed, wait a second, delete it and
launch a new.

Due to the asynchronous nature of the engine, there might be a slightly
fluctuation in how long some of the related resources survive, the important
thing is to see that these do not accumulate over time.
