Leddec is a simple PoC for an external FIFO based LED controller.

To enable, simply create a FIFO (global namespace), e.g.
mkfifo /tmp/led

and then set the corresponding key:
arcan_db add_appl_kv arcan ext_led /tmp/led

run leddec /tmp/led and then arcan with some appl that uses the led functionality
