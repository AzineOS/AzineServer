-- benchmark_timestamp
-- @short: Timestamp function
-- @inargs: *stratum*
-- @outargs: timev
-- @longdescr: Retrieve a timestamp value. The optional *stratum* argument
-- specifies what kind of timekeeping source should be used, where the
-- default value will be some kind of monotonic clock in millisecond
-- resolution and stratum 1 is set as system time in seconds since epoch
-- (1970-01-01).
-- @note: As the name implies, this is primarily intended for benchmarking
-- purposes. Real-world timekeeping cases should be avoided if possible as
-- the API does not contain sufficient functions for handling the usecases
-- that appear when dealing with locales, adjustments etc.
-- @group: system
-- @cfunction: timestamp
