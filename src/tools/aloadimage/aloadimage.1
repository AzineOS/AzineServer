.SH NAME
aloadimage \- load images into an arcan window
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B aclip [global_options] file ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIaloadimage\fR displays images in an arcan window. Each image is parsed in a
separate and sandboxed process. If multiple images are provided, a certain
number of items will be decoded in advance.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-l, \-\-loop\fR"
When the playlist reaches the end, it will loop back from the beginning
rather than shutting down.

.IP "\fB\-t, \-\-step\-time\fR"
Set the playlist automatic stepping time (default: 0, manual control).

.IP "\fB\-b, \-\-block-input\fR"
Ignore all keyboard and mouse input.

.IP "\fB\-d, \-\-display\fR \fIconnpath\fR"
By default, the ARCAN_CONNPATH environment is used in order to find an arcan
instance to connect to. This argument ignores that in favor for the connpath
argument.

.IP "\fB-m, \-\-limit\-mem\fR \fIlimit(mb)\fR"
Limit the maximum decoded memory sized allowed for eaching loading process.

.IP "\fB-T, \-\-timeout\fR \fItimeout(seconds)\fR"
Stop/kill a worker process if it fails to decode an image within a certain
number of seconds.

.IP "\FB-r, \-\-readahead\fR \fIlimit(count)\fR"
Set the readahead limit for worker processes preloading playlist contents.

.IP "\fX\-x, \-\-no\-sysflt\fR
aloadimage may be built with syscall filtering for worker processes. This may
break image loading in some environments/libc implementations and may therefore
need to be disabled.

.IP "\fB\-h, \-\-help\fR"
Show a brief summary of commands and usage.

.SH LIMITATIONS

Advanced rendering configuration options are still not available. Other than
scaled blitting, there are no filter controls, no orientation transforms.

Color space selection options like sRGB are missing, as is support for
accelerated buffer transfers via OpenGL and native HDR transfers.

These will be fixed (in time).

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.SM
\fBARCAN_CONNPATH\fR
Name of the connection point to use when connecting to arcan.
.TP

\fBARCAN_CONNKEY\fR
Key to use for authenticating againgst the connection path.
