-- snapshot_target
-- @short: Request that a frameserver serializes its internal state into the
-- specified resource.
-- @inargs: targetid, resname
-- @outargs: statusbool 
-- @longdescr: Frameservers running targets that expose the snapshot capability
-- can have their states stored and restored. This function opens the resource
-- in the main process and then passes the file-handle to the process connected
-- to the specific target.
-- @note: This function is scheduled to have some revisions in coming versions,
-- most notably a. limiting traversal for resname, b. allowing namespace specifier
-- (SHARED or PRIVATE) and c. allowing hints on intended use (FULL or MINIMAL).
-- @group: targetcontrol 
-- @cfunction: arcan_lua_targetsnapshot
