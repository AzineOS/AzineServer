This folder contains miniature, hacked together, scripts
used to assist in development or test some specific 
engine features and are not to be considered proper
"examples of use" (see the examples/ folder for that).

It is currently being refactored into the following 
substructure:

api_coverage/ (WIP) scripts that use the C pre-processor 
to extract examples and error cases from the documentation in 
doc/*.lua 

benchmark/ (WIP) specialized non-interactive cases that 
attempt to quantify performance boundaries for various platforms.

build/ (WIP) OS- specific "checkout, iterate platforms and build"

security/ (WIP) planned for fuzzing- tools on known interfaces,
particularly for frameserver->arcan events and in the sad cases
where that occurs, CVE- reference + exploit. Issues that cover
the border between scripting interface and main engine will
be covered in api_coverage and regression.

interactive/ quick hacks and experiments, particularly when
developing a new- or refactoring an existing- interface or 
when we still need manual interception.

regression/ for non-trivial bugs reported and fixed, an example
that provoced the issue pre-fix should be added to this folder
along with the fix, in order to have a growing base of regression
cases to run with any new release.
