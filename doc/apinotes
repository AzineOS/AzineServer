[ Planned API changes ]
 a. let 3d plane etc. be attachable as a mesh or collidable to model
    for cheap debug-geometry etc.

 b. play_audio should have the side effect of flushing the buffers 
    to a frameserver

 c. random_surface need some love; specifying other kinds of lower 
    frequency noise e.g. perlin would be good

 d. poor error handling in rendertarget attach
 
 e. reset image transform should return the number of ticks left in chain

 f. instant_image_transform should really be able to create a new vid instead,
    and store existing objects

 g. MRT for WORLDID rendertarget/recordtarget incomplete

 h. snapkey in snapshot function does not prevent escaping atm.

 i. snapshot should have the option to allow local or shared

 j. snapshot should have the option to hint delta or complete
