-- resume_target
-- @short: Request that the targetid resumes from a previously paused state.
-- @inargs: targetvid
-- @longdescr: There are two principal pause/resume mechanisms that
-- overlap slightly. resume_movie guarantee that the audio/video playback
-- sampling will be paused in the main engine. This implies that queued
-- buffers (decode- sessions can maintain a preset number of cached audio/video
-- frames) will be kept intact. The related resume_target sends a request
-- to the target frameserver or hijack sessions and blocks the process to
-- whatever extent is possible.
