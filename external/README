For some build-environments where you want tight control over which dependencies
that are linked statically / dynamically and how these libraries are configured,
some additional measures are needed.

On systems with the dependencies for [video/input platforms] fulfilled,
the only needed libraries should be openctm, openal, freetype, sqlite3, and luajit.

For openal/freetype/luajit, there is a bash script in external/git/clone.sh that
downloads the repositories. CMake will check for the corresponding folders during
configuration, and for the ones that are found, the normal FindModule will be
side-stepped.

To set up manually, just make sure that the following git mapping is correct:

http://luajit.org/git/luajit-2.0.git external/luajit
git://git.sv.nongnu.org/freetype/freetype2.git external/freetype
git://github.com/mirros/openal-soft.git external/openal

Note that for OpenAL, only LWA will use the git mirror (in order to apply
patches) by default. For regular arcan, -DSTATIC_OPENAL=ON must also be specified.
